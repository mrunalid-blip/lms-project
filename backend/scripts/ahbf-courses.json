    "description": "This fellowship provides structured exposure to both cranial and spinal surgical disciplines. Participants learn surgical anatomy, diagnostic protocols, and decision-making frameworks for neurological and spinal disorders. The course covers degenerative spine disease, trauma, tumor management, and congenital abnormalities. Hands-on training involves assisting in surgeries such as laminectomies, spinal fixations, and minimally invasive procedures. Fellows are trained in microsurgical and navigation-assisted techniques. The program emphasizes preoperative planning and intraoperative imaging interpretation. Learners work closely with neurosurgeons and spine specialists in operating rooms and rehabilitation units. Exposure to neurophysiology labs enhances understanding of nerve conduction and electrophysiological mapping. Academic sessions include radiology reviews, journal clubs, and multidisciplinary case audits. Fellows study the biomechanics of the spine and the evolution of surgical approaches. Simulation and cadaveric workshops improve technical competence and hand–eye coordination. Ethical and medico-legal considerations in neurosurgery are also integrated into the curriculum. The program develops analytical skills required for clinical research and outcome assessment. Fellows gain experience in rehabilitation protocols and postoperative management. Upon completion, participants demonstrate clinical judgment, surgical dexterity, and interdisciplinary collaboration. They are prepared to manage neuro-spinal conditions in tertiary and research institutions. The fellowship fosters lifelong learning and academic leadership in neuro-spine care.",
